Refrence : https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/dockerizing-a-ruby-on-rails-application

Prerequisites:
Installing Docker on your machine .
Kubernate cluster .
you can use minikube or kubeadm to build a cluster on your local machines , kops to build a cluster on a cloud provider like aws or gcloud
